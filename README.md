# Creating a Five Star Portfolio - Introduction  

## Introduction
At this point, all of your module projects and your capstone project are hosted on GitHub. As you may have experienced, the Data Science program is pretty intense, so now is the time to look back at your repositories and clean them up. While data projects are, by their nature exploratory, with lots of sketching and preparatory data work. The final product - especially something that sits atop your resume as the first thing you are asking a hiring manager to look at - needs to be clear and clean.

Your project repositories allow employers to see the quality of your work before ever speaking with you. They establish your brand as a data scientist. Best practices demonstrated in your repos demonstrate what you are capable of on the job.

The first things an employer should see in your repository:
* Your current skill set, as showcased within easy to find and recent project repositories
* Your work is in-line with industry expectations
* Your skills in writing about the key concepts encompassing your craft
* How you target your communication to the expected audience

## Objectives
You will be able to:
* Examine the format of a few sample repositories
* Examine the content of a few sample repositories
* Apply these concepts to your own repository in labs

## Part 1: Expected Repository Structure
* Identify key issues within an example unorganized data science project repository
* Review __industry standards__ and employer expectations for project organization
* List steps taken to adjust the sample repo to align with industry expectations
* Use Git and terminal commands to adjust your own project repository
* Maintain a repository that will showcase your skillset to employers

## Part 2: Skilled Project Communication 
* Identify blockers in the __content__ of the project documents themselves
* Use a checklist to review the text and organization of the project description and README
* Examine the impact of using markdown and commenting code to improve readability
* Connect the lesson exercises to the growth areas in your project documentation
* Use the communication tools learned in this section to revise your own project repository accordingly
